<p class="ex2"> HELLO WORLD ASSIGNMENT </p>
<b>
  1. My name is Michael Adenew. I am a junior with a computer science major.
  <br><br>
  2. I am taking this course because it seems really cool and fun.
  <br><br>
  3. I have no experience creating websites but I have coded before.
  <br><br>
  4. My goals are to build skills through this class to develop
  as a software engineer.
  <br><br>
  5. For my learn-computing activities, I did the file organization and naming
  and command line.
  I thought the file organization was definately helpful. I've known the
  importance of organizing my laptop folders and files, but I've had
  trouble with it before. This was due to making mistakes and creating
  repeated folders that actually complicate more than simplify what I store.
  The naming convention and other teachings were helpful, and I will go
  back again through my computer and organize it. If I get stuck, I will come to
  office hours.
  The second activity I did was the command line interface. I know a little
  bit about command line control, but I get confused often, so the slides were
  really good. I plan on going back over them to save the synatx for the most
  used commands and to create my own notes that I can always refer to.
  <br><br>
  6.3 web-based projects I would like to do are building an interactive website,
  creating a clone of an app I use called notion, and creating an online game.
  I've looked at some of the best websites from a tournament before and have
  been amazed by what people were able to build. I didn't see myself building
  anything like that so soon, so I would like to attempt it. The second project
  about Notion is an app I use daily. It has a simple design but is really
  powerful. Lastly, I used to play online games as a kid, so it would be
  really cool to finally be on the opposite end of the computer and be the
  one creating the games for people to enjoy.
  <br><br>
  7. No part of the actual assignment was difficult. The most challenging part
  was setting up and remember the appropriate steps to get set up. However, as
  we practice more and more, I know that this will get easier.
